This was my personal website written in plain css, JavaScript and PHP. I'm creating a new blog site that will be in Spring MVC backend and React frontend.

The Interests and Contact page is written in PHP which was initially hosted in heroku but I have stopped the hosting and will migrate the code to a better resilient backend code in Spring MVC.

This was the website: https://mohitsshetty986.github.io
