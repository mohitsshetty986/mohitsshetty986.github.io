This was my personal website written in plain css, JavaScript and PHP. This site was not updated as I had planned on creating a different site using different stack. 

My new blog site will be in Spring MVC backend and React frontend.

The Interests and Contact page is written in PHP which was initially hosted in heroku but I have stopped the hosting and will migrate the code to a better resilient backend code in Spring MVC.

This was the website: https://mohitsshetty986.github.io. (was done before my Masters program)
