						<p class="small-text">It goes without saying that the personal computer revolutionized businesses and homes around the globe, but what was the very first one that served as the de facto standard for the PCs of today? We have to travel back to 1969 when an engineer working at Kirtland Airforce base in New Mexico, Henry Edward Roberts together with 3 other colleagues, with their electronics background decided to sell small kits for model rocket hobbyists. They founded "Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems" (MITS) in Roberts' garage and started selling radio transmitters and instruments for model rockets which didn't achieve market success and they switched to selling calculator kits. In April 1974, Intel launched the 8080A CPU, which was capable of addressing up to 64kb of RAM and so based on several improved models of calculator kits, Robert decided to design an Intel 8080 computer. There was a sizable customer base at schools, colleges, electronic enthusiasts who knew about and wanted to have computers and the available Intel 8008 based computer at the time was not powerful enough to run a high level language like BASIC. Robert came up with the first prototype of Intel 8080 in October 1974 which was more powerful than Intel 8008, designed as an expandable system, that opened it up to all sorts of applications. <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">Les Solomon from the popular magazine "Popular Electronics" who knew about Robert's work thought of the Intel 8080 computer as an attention-grabbing cover story and thus the Altair 8800 (Popular Electronics editors came up with this name and not Roberts) was launched in market and was an instant success with 40000 units sold. Initially programming the Altair was tedious with no keyboards and users had to repeatedly toggle switches corresponding to a microprocessor instruction in binary and use enter switch to load the code into memory until all the instructions of a complete program were in place. The rudimentary computer was upgraded to a $439 Computer kit that had 2 memory boards of 1024 words and 4096 words, Parallel and Serial Interface Boards, a paper tape reader for storage, Audio Cassette Interface Board, a 300KB floppy drive and a Teletype. After an article release on Altair in January 1975, Roberts was contacted by a Harvard undergrad Bill Gates and his friend Paul Allen who offered to create a BASIC interpreter, using a self-made simulator. After they had a version working, Allen flew to MITS, to deliver the first program which was also the "Micro-Soft's founding product Altair BASIC". The first program ever typed in Altair BASIC was "print 2+2" and after typing "run" it typed back the correct answer: "4". The January 1975 article also led to the creation of Homebrew Computer Club of electronic hobbyists headed by the Apple Computer founders Steve Wozniack and Steve Jobs.</span> <button class="read">read more</button></p>

						<img src="facts/gigafactory.jpg" id="myImg" class="factimg" alt="Gigafactory Nevada">
						<p class="small-text"> Do you know what the most important thing Tesla makes ? Elon Musk calls it a Giant machine that builds a machine. A futuristic manufacturing facility primarily producing lithium-ion batteries - 13 million per day and electric motors for the Tesla Model 3, Tesla’s cheapest-ever car, plus the Powerwall and Powerpack energy storage systems designed to work with renewable sources. It's called the "GIGAFACTORY". There are 5 proposed Gigafactory projects around globe - Nevada, New York, Berlin, Shanghai and Texas. Gigafactory is being built with the end in mind of being a net-zero facility. There'll be over 200,000 solar panels on the roof, with the largest array of solar panels anywhere to provide most of the building’s energy, paired with Tesla’s batteries. The size of each Gigafactory is massive with the Sparx Nevada based facility being the biggest. <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">On completion it will be the biggest building in the world by footprint about 15 million square feet of land, and the second biggest by volume. It's large enough to house 107 NFL football fields or 93 Boeing 747s. Musk says the whole point of the massive facility is to make batteries that can be used to store renewable energy like solar more affordable. Working alongside factories 7000 employees, are a team of automated robots that help move materials using digital maps between workstations faster and lift heavier loads staying charged for 19 hours. Currently Tesla produces 60 percent of the Globe's EV batteries and is planning to ramp production to 500,000 cars per year which would require today's entire worldwide supply of lithium-ion batteries. With battery production more than all other carmakers combined in terms of kWh, Tesla is accelerating to achieve production of terawatt-hour battery (per year), the million mile battery for future cars which will hold more charge and have lower price point. Tesla's current cost to manufacture a battery cell is $116 per KWH which is far ahead of the industry- $146 per KWH. Tesla's project Road runner aims to reduce costs to $100 per KWH by 2021. Building a massive facility which runs on 100% renewable energy source as the Gigafactory means increased production, decreased cost, reduction of waste, and the simple optimization of locating most manufacturing processes under one roof.</span> <button class="read">read more</button></p>

						<img src="facts/goldernrecord.jpg" id="myImg1" class="factimg" alt="Goldern Record">
						<p class="small-text">Have you ever heard about the Voyager mission ? It's the real interstellar mission and the most distant human-made object in space. In 1977, Voyager 1 & Voyager 2 were launched aboard a Titan-Centaur rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, with the mission objective to explore the Solar system beyond the neighborhood of the outer planets to the outer limits of the Sun's sphere of influence, and possibly beyond. After exploring volcanic activities on Jupiter's moon IO and closely studying the intricacies of Saturn's rings, with the additional flybys of the two outermost planets Uranus and Neptune the Voyager 1 made the historic entry into interstellar space in 2012 followed by Voyager 2 in 2018. Since it's launch in 1977 Voyager 1 has travelled more than 22.3 billion km at a speed of about 3.6 AU per year and Voyager 2 has travelled a distance of 18.5 billion km at a speed of about 3.3 AU per year from sun. <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">Being so far from earth how does the Voyager communicate ? A 20 KiloWatt signal is transmitted from Earth to Voyager using radio waves which takes almost 20 hours for the signal to reach the space probe where it's sensitive 3.4 meter diameter antenna picks up the signal. Voyager sends information and pictures taken in realtime back to the Deep Space Network (DSN), a collection of big radio antennas, powerful enough to make sense of the faint signals received which is 20 billion times weaker than what's needed to run a digital watch. These antennas are located in California, Canberra and Madrid. Those sites are almost evenly spaced around the planet which means as the Earth turns, we never lose sight of a spacecraft. These spacecrafts are continuing to characterize the outer solar system environment and search for the heliopause boundary, the outer limits of the Sun's magnetic field and outward flow of the solar wind, until around the year 2025 when their ability to generate adequate electrical power for continued science instrument operation will come to an end. A very interesting fact of these spacecrafts is they carry a phonograph, gold-plated copper disk, known as the 'GOLDERN RECORD'. This 12-inch disk contains sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth. It's kind of a time capsule, intended to communicate a story of our world to extraterrestrials. </span> <button class="read">read more</button></p>

						<img src="facts/hyperloop.jpg" id="myImg" class="factimg" alt="Virgin Hyperloop One">
						<p class="small-text"> Billed as the fastest way to cross the surface of the earth, hyperloop represents the greatest leap in transport infrastructure for generations. With passengers sitting in pods that travel at airline speed through pressurised tubes using electric propulsion and magnetic levitation, the concept promises to slash journey times between major cities from several hours to a matter of minutes. Whilst it may feel like science fiction, hyperloop is now on the cusp of becoming a reality. Hyperloop was first concieved in 2012 by Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, and engineers from both SpaceX and Tesla Motors worked for 9 months on creating a reasonable engineering and cost-assessment proposal for the hyperloop which was released in August 2013. Design of a realistic hyperloop poses numerous technical and economic challeges. Musk has set out his vision for a futuristic, super high-speed transportation pods that moves through a partial vacuum in steel tubes - addressing the two key factors that slow down conventional vehicle: Friction and Air resistance. <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">To alleviate friction between the pod and the tube, one possible mechanism is the magnetic levitation using very large permanent magnets to suspend the pod above the bottom of the tube. However this idea is dismissed due to higher costs. In his proposal Musk suggested a second possible method similar to the concept of air bearings in an air hockey table, using a cushion of air to support pods and eliminate rolling resistance. Pod will be driven on an electromagnetic track laid on a tunnel floor and when current is fed through the track, the pod moves forward, accelerating until a speed where it lifts up and is guided by magnets. The hyperloop partially-vacuum tubes will operate at very low pressure to reduce air resistance and an electric compressor fan will be fixed on the nose of the pod to pump high-pressure air from in front of the pod to behind the pod. Therefore, Hyperloop pods can mostly glide without applying much thrust. Musk believed a potential Los Angeles - San Francisco route could be traversed in about 30 minutes, compared to the 8 hour bus ride, 4 hour train journey and convoluted 3 hour air travel between the 2 cities. SpaceX has announced an open competition, geared towards university students and independent engineering teams, to design and build the best Hyperloop pod. </span> <button class="read">read more</button></p>
